# Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that allows combining the content of one image with the style of another image to create a composite image that maintains the content of the original but adopts the stylistic elements of the second image. This project showcases the use of NST for artistic applications, photo editing, and more.

## Overview
Neural Style Transfer (NST) leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly using pre-trained models like VGG-19, to perform style transfer by optimizing the pixel values of the input image.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is performed using a pre-trained VGG-19 model to get the content and style representations of the images. These features are then used to compute the content and style losses.

## Gram Matrix
The Gram matrix is used to capture the style of the image by representing the correlations between different filter responses of the CNN.

## Loss Function
Content Loss:
Measures how much the content of the generated image deviates from the content image.

Style Loss:
Measures how much the style of the generated image deviates from the style image.

## Generating the Stylized Image
The stylized image is generated by optimizing the pixel values of the content image to minimize the combined content and style loss.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/archie-a18/Neural-Style-Transfer.git
2. Copy code
3. Upload the code file to Google Colab.
4. Run all the code cells in the Jupyter notebook to perform the style transfer.
5. Choose your content and style images.
